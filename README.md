# LetSTwitt

This is a Twitter Clone . Creating for learning Purposes.
Will not be used as any kind of Business, or Reklaming.
It will stay as a Learning project and will not be treated as any kind of real world Websites.

The main purpose of creating the App was in order to teach myself Ruby on Rails ( Ruby framework).
There may be Bugs or Issues , so it will not be a perfect App becaus it was just created in order to get more comfortable with the framework.

Meanwhile i will do my best with it and make it as great as i can.

This project was an [ASSIGNMENT](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/authentication) at my Ruby on Rails course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).
